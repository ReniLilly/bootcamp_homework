<h2> METHOD:</h2>
         <p>1. Into a pan or kadai add in the cleaned fish, turmeric powder, pepper powder, vinegar, salt, and water. Mix well and cover and cook the fish (allow the water to dry up).</p>
         <P>2. Once the fish is cooked remove the fish from its bones and keep aside.</P>
         <p>3. Heat a kadai or pan with oil. Add in finely sliced onions, green chilies, ginger, and curry leaves. Mix well and all this to lightly brown.</p>
         <p>4. Once the onions starts to brown, put the flame on the lowest and add in the fish pieces lightly crumbling with your fingers. Mix this very well.</p>
         <p>5. Add in pepper powder and mix well again.</p>
         <p>6. Add in the potatoes, lightly crumbling with your fingers and add salt and mix well. Mix this on low flame for about 2-3 minutes. The idea is to absorb the moisture; if there is moisture (wetness) either from the potatoes or from the fish, the cutlets will break while frying. So to avoid that, you need to make sure that the mix is very dry and sauting on low flame is needed for that.</p>
         <p>7. Add in vinegar and pepper powder. Mix well, once the mix is dry, allow it to cool down completely.</p>
         <p>8. Once the mix is cooled down; pinch off small balls and make into oval or round shape.</p>
         <p>9. Dip each cutlet into beaten egg and then in breadcrumbs. Deep fry them in hot oil</p> 
         <p>10.Serve with tomato sauce or onion salad or with sliced tomatoes, lemon and a sprinkle of coriander leaves or with rice ..as your choice.</p> 
            

         <h3>NOTES</h3>

         <ul>
            <li>For fish recipes, I do not use garam masala but if you prefer you can add in a fat pinch.</li>
            <li>To save time, you can mince all this in the food processor.</li>
            <li>When you mix the mix make sure you mash the potato lumps (if there is any) with the spoon.</li>
            <li>You can increase or decrease pepper and green chilies according to your taste.</li>
            <li>Pls check the video for more tips and how to make breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>To get that authentic Kerala taste use coconut oil. You can bread the cutlets and store them in the fridge for upto 3 days and fry when needed.</li>
